On the way back to my room, I saw another new STAR unit hit her head on a door frame.\n<page>Date: 84-21-9 \nHad to go down to the mining site today for the scheduled inspection. The new Elster unit was showing some surveying equipment to me, when something she said about planets and stars suddenly made me realize what that dial reminded me of - an astronomical calendar. I will have to investigate further at once now that my shift is over.\n<page>Date: 84-21-A \nThe little enigma of that box could only distract me from the dullness of work for so long. All the box contained was a small notebook, of which all pages turned out to be blank. While the mechanism is fascinating, I'm not quite sure what to do with the box yet. Would it make a nice gift for the Commander? Maybe I should ask Kolibri what she thinks.\n<page>Date: 84-21-B \nIn a fit of adventurousness, I decided to try something new for dinner and promptly regretted it - I could barely stomach the taste. Such a detestable combination of sweet and savoury, it made me sick.\n<page>Date: 84-21-C \nAnother diary filled, for no benefit but my own satisfaction.

In some cases, this may lead to the Unit being less efficient for its intended purpose. This is called Persona degradation.\n<page>Using a wealth of private information about the life of the Gestalt each neural pattern is based on allows us to ensure optimal, uniform post-deployment development of each unit. \nIn simpler terms, our primary objective is the focused manipulation of the individual to ensure they remain as close to the original pattern as possible, and thus productive, loyal and docile for as long as possible.\n<page>This is called Persona stabilization. Stabilization can come in many forms, and usually takes on the form of regular activities or Fetish Objects that distract and calm the Replika.\n<page>Until the development of Bioresonance Technology that allows wide-scale direct behavior control, the methods of Operational Psychology still remain the most reliable way to control both Replikas and Gestalts in the interest of the protection of national security."

To preserve the image of the Replika as an incorruptible ideal, the original Gestalt is erased from records and public memory.\n<page>During the production process, when experienced bioresonant technicians copy that neural pattern to a new unit, a majority of episodic memories are altered and suppressed.\n<page>While the resulting Replika maintains the skills and personality of the original Gestalt, it will be incapable to recall specific events from the life of the donor under normal circumstances.\nThis ensures the Replika performs its duties without distractions created by personal memories of the donor.\n<page>However, even the best-maintained Replika unit will eventually be exposed to stimuli that may cause Gestalt memories to resurface. While units degraded in such a way pose no particular danger, like all units with Persona degradation, they will eventually lose many of their advantages over Gestalt workers.\n<page>Because Persona Degradation is usually difficult to identify from the outside, bioresonance is used by command units to surveil units under their command. Generally, it is recommended to swiftly decommission and replace units before their productivity decreases or they begin to show clear signs of individuality.\nWhen ammunition is rationed, alternative ways of decommissioning may be deployed at the discretion of local Operational Command."

I long for her stern guidance, that overwhelming authority in which she bathes a room. \n<page>Date: 84-21-B \nMore sick, making my work ever harder.

Persona degradation can be easily prevented in this unit by making sure they have access to music (through tape players or musical instruments).

Training them in patience early after deployment is key, as their neural pattern is less stable than other models.
